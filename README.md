# `${HOME}/.config/nvim`

This is my `nvim` configuration. The ideas are taken from everywhere on th internet. The main usecase for this configuration is `C/C++` development, `python` scripting and `latex` typesetting. I am a particle physics student at University of Genoa, working on neutrino physics.
